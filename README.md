## üì¶ **Installation & Usage**  
**‚≠ê Run the WebServer and access it via the Web Browser**

   git clone https://github.com/drclcomputers/GOWEATHER
   ```

   cd GOWEATHER
   ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Server executable
   ```bash
   go build
   ```
4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the server executable and navigate to **"localhost:8090"** in your Browser.

**‚≠ê Run it as a Desktop WebApp**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drclcomputers/GOWEATHER
   ```  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd GOWEATHER
   ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Install the dependencies with npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Server executable:
   ```bash
   go build -o server
   ```
   ‚ÄºÔ∏è Note: For Windows, write **"server.exe"**. Otherwise leave it as is.
   
5Ô∏è‚É£ Test the App:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
6Ô∏è‚É£ Build an executable:
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```

!!! On Fedora, from what I've tested, this method works. However, in Debian-based or Ununtu-like distros you have to run the commands below to give some permisions.
   ```bash
   sudo chown root:root node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
   sudo chmod 4755 node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox
   ```
!!! I am still unable to figure out why the Appimage won't work. Until then, please use **"npm start"** in the main folder or additionally go to **"dist/linux-unpacked*"**and run **"./goweather"**.
