## üìã **Requirements (only for building it yourself)**
‚òëÔ∏è **NodeJS >= 18.17.1**<br>
‚òëÔ∏è **GO (golang) >= 1.22**<br>
‚òëÔ∏è **Electron >= 35.0.3**

## üì¶ **Installation & Usage**  
**‚≠ê Run the WebServer and access it via the Web Browser**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the release for your operating system.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract the content.

3Ô∏è‚É£ In the dearchived folder, run the server executable ("server.exe" for Windows, "server" for other OSes).

‚ÄºÔ∏è Note: For Linux, you'll have to run 
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x server
   ```
to make the server an executable.
    
4Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to **"localhost:8090"** in your Browser.
<br><br><br>
**‚≠ê Run it as a Desktop WebApp**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the release for your operating system.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract the content.

‚ÄºÔ∏è Due to some problems with permissions on Linux, you should run
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x install.sh
   ```
before, to give permissions to the install script and then run
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
to install the app.

3Ô∏è‚É£ In the dearchived folder, run the "goweather" executable ("goweather.exe" for Windows, "goweather" for other OSes).

**‚≠ê Build it yourself**

**‚ÄºÔ∏è Only for professionals**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use git clone to clone the repo.

2Ô∏è‚É£ In the repo's folder, run
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Then compile the server with
   ```bash
   go build -o server
   ```
3Ô∏è‚É£ After this, use 
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
or
   ```bash
   npm run dist
   ```
to build the app.

‚ÄºÔ∏è On Linux, you should give the permissions 
   ```bash
   sudo chown root:root ./chrome-sandbox
   sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
   ```
to chrome-sandbox before, to avoid further problems. Even after doing this, you still won't be able to install the app via the newly created AppImage due to the format's flawed design. I recommend using the first method instead. Build it at your own sanity's risk.
